            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Nelson Mandel was the first democratically elected president of South Africa. He is considered to be one
                of the most influential and inspiring leader of the 20th century for his contribution in fostering peaceful reconciliation by being a forefronter of the anti-aparthied movement.</p>

            <p>
                Nelson was able to reunite very polarised nation through the act of forgiveness rather than seeking
                retaliation or revenage. He used rugby as a vehicle to overcome the aparthied segregation and racism even though the rugby was symbolised as the sports of Afrikans exclusively. Nelson's gesture of forgiveness by endorsing rugby players, demonstrates that one must transcend from the past legacy instead of acting on fear - to forgive than to avenage. His great leadership was recognised internationally and Nelson was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.
